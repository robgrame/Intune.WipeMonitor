**Automated device lifecycle management after Intune wipe (factory reset) actions.**

Monitors Microsoft Intune for completed device wipe operations and orchestrates the cleanup of device objects from Autopilot, Active Directory, SCCM, and Intune — ensuring no device is removed until the wipe is confirmed as done. Sends Teams notifications for approval requests.

## How It Works

1. **Polling** — A background service queries the Microsoft Graph API every 60 minutes (configurable):
   ```
   GET /beta/deviceManagement/remoteActionAudits?$filter=action eq 'factoryReset'
   ```
2. **Detection** — Devices with `actionState == "done"` are flagged as ready for cleanup
3. **Notification** — A Teams Adaptive Card is sent to the configured channel with device details and an "Approve" button
4. **Approval** — An operator reviews and approves the cleanup from the Blazor dashboard (Entra ID auth required)
5. **SID Cross-Validation** — Before any deletion, the agent validates the device identity across all systems:
   - Retrieves the computer **SID** (`objectSid`) from Active Directory
   - Retrieves the device **SID** from SCCM (`SMS_R_System.SID`)
   - Compares AD SID ↔ SCCM SID to ensure the same physical device
   - If SIDs don't match, the cleanup is **blocked** with a `SidMismatch` result
6. **Cleanup** — The orchestrator executes 4 steps in sequence:
   - **① Autopilot** → Graph API delete `windowsAutopilotDeviceIdentities` (cloud)
   - **② Active Directory** → LDAP delete via on-prem Gateway Agent (SignalR)
   - **③ SCCM** → AdminService REST delete via on-prem Gateway Agent (SignalR)
   - **④ Intune** → Graph API delete `managedDevices` (cloud)
   - **Entra ID** → Automatically cleaned up after AD sync
7. **Result Notification** — Teams card with cleanup result (✅ success / ❌ failure)
8. **Auditing** — Every action is tracked with custom Application Insights events, including matched SIDs

## Projects

| Project | Description |
|---|---|
| `Intune.WipeMonitor` | ASP.NET Core Blazor Server web app (Azure) |
| `Intune.WipeMonitor.Agent` | Worker Service / Windows Service (on-premises) |
| `Intune.WipeMonitor.Shared` | Shared models, contracts, enums, CMTrace formatter |

## Application Insights Custom Events

All cleanup operations emit structured custom events for auditing and monitoring:

| Event Name | When |
|---|---|
| `DeviceCleanup.Approved` | Operator approves a device cleanup |
| `DeviceCleanup.Skipped` | Operator skips a device |
| `DeviceCleanup.AutopilotDeletion` | Autopilot identity deletion attempted |
| `DeviceCleanup.ADDeletion` | AD object deletion attempted (emitted by both cloud and agent) |
| `DeviceCleanup.SCCMDeletion` | SCCM device deletion attempted (emitted by both cloud and agent) |
| `DeviceCleanup.IntuneDeletion` | Intune device deletion attempted |
| `DeviceCleanup.Completed` | Full cleanup completed successfully |
| `DeviceCleanup.Failed` | Cleanup failed on at least one target |
| `Agent.Connected` | On-prem agent connected to the hub |
| `Agent.Disconnected` | On-prem agent disconnected |
| `WipePoll.Completed` | Graph API polling cycle completed |
| `WipePoll.WipeDetected` | New completed wipe detected |

## SID Cross-Validation

The agent implements a safety chain to prevent accidental deletion of wrong devices:

```
CleanupCommand (device name + EntraDeviceId)
     │
     ▼
┌─────────────┐    objectSid     ┌─────────────┐
│  Active     │ ──────────────►  │  Compare    │
│  Directory  │    (LDAP)        │  AD SID     │
└─────────────┘                  │  vs         │
                                 │  SCCM SID   │──► Match? → Proceed with deletion
┌─────────────┐    SID           │             │──► Mismatch? → Block (SidMismatch)
│  SCCM       │ ──────────────►  │             │
│  AdminSvc   │   (REST)         └─────────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

- If **AD SID ≠ SCCM SID**: deletion is blocked, `StepResult.SidMismatch` is returned
- The matched SID is included in the `CleanupStepResult` for audit trail
- All SID validation results are logged in CMTrace format and tracked in Application Insights

**Example KQL queries:**

```kql
// All cleanup actions in the last 24h
customEvents
| where name startswith "DeviceCleanup"
| where timestamp > ago(24h)
| project timestamp, name, 
    DeviceName = tostring(customDimensions.DeviceName),
    Result = tostring(customDimensions.Result),
    Error = tostring(customDimensions.ErrorMessage)
| order by timestamp desc

// Failed deletions
customEvents
| where name in ("DeviceCleanup.ADDeletion", "DeviceCleanup.SCCMDeletion")
| where customDimensions.Result == "Failed"
| project timestamp, name,
    DeviceName = tostring(customDimensions.DeviceName),
    Error = tostring(customDimensions.ErrorMessage)
```

## Teams Notifications

When a wipe is completed and a device needs approval, an **Adaptive Card** is sent to a Microsoft Teams channel via Incoming Webhook:

- 📢 **Approval request** — device name, owner, wipe date, "Open Approvals" button
- ✅/❌ **Cleanup result** — device name, who approved, success or failure

### Setup

1. In Teams, create an **Incoming Webhook** in the desired channel (Settings → Connectors → Incoming Webhook)
2. Set `WipeMonitor:TeamsWebhookUrl` in App Configuration or App Settings
3. Optionally set `WipeMonitor:DashboardUrl` for the "Open Approvals" button link

## Logging — CMTrace Format

Both the web app and the agent write log files in **CMTrace format** (`<![LOG[...]LOG]!>`), compatible with:
- **CMTrace.exe** (SCCM toolkit)
- **OneTrace** (Configuration Manager)

Logs are written to `logs/wipemonitor-web-YYYYMMDD.log` and `logs/wipemonitor-agent-YYYYMMDD.log` with automatic daily rolling and 30-day retention.
